It's a lovely morning at Smith College, and you are a horrible squirrel. 

**Premise** 
It's a beautiful fall Mountain Day at Smith College. Birds are singing, the sun is shining, students are frolicking on the lawn and eating donuts—and you, a dastardly campus squirrel, are here to take 
advantage of the chaos of cancelled classes. Your objective? Collect as much food as possible throughout campus and stash it to prepare yourself for the unforgiving Massachusetts winter. You will be given points based
on how many food items you collect, their value (delicious donuts are worth more than peanuts), and how well you hide your goodies from other thieving squirrels. Beware! These point values are hidden until the game is
over; you'll have to use your best judgement to make choices. When you've finished your squirrely escapades, return to your nest. I'll tally up your points and reveal how well prepared you are for winter!
